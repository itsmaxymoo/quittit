# quittit!

A collection of resources to aide in quitting reddit.

## Contributing

Edit `index.md` to edit the content of the website.
Edits must prioritize ease of use; we want it to
be as easy as possible for people to use our site. We
don't want them going back to reddit!
Additionally, resources should remain as platform-agnostic
as possible. quittit can be used to quit sites other than reddit!

Sections should remain relatively small and easy to understand.
Style and structure can be modified in the other various HTML files.
Javascript should be avoided.
