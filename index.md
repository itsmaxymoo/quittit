## For the Short Term

* Catch up on the [news](https://apnews.com) 📰
* **Do some chores**
* Read a [random Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random)...
* Practice a new language on [Duolingo](https://duolingo.com) 🇩🇪🇫🇷🇪🇸
* Draw something ✍️
* Write something!
* Practice mindfulness! It's okay to be bored!
Make observations about the world around you.
What are your feelings on that?

> The more we try to live in the world of words, the more we feel isolated and alone, the more all the joy and liveliness of things is exchanged for mere certainty and security. On the other hand, the more we are forced to admit that we actually live in the real world, the more we feel ignorant, uncertain, and insecure about everything.

*- Alan Watts*

## Instead of a Long Session

### Go Outside 🌳🌲🌵

* Go for a walk, run, or bicycle ride!
* Plan a hike with [AllTrails](https://www.alltrails.com/) 🌄
* Compete with locals on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/) 🏃🚲
* Go on a real life treasure hunt and [geocache](https://www.geocaching.com/play)!

### Try Reading 📖

* Get some cheap, used books at [AbeBooks](https://abebooks.com), your local bookstore, or a yard sale
* Track your reading with [Goodreads](https://goodreads.com), and get recommendations!

Some good books to get you started:

* *The Wisdom of Insecurity* by Alan Watts
* *The Autobiography of Malcolm X* by Malcolm X
* *The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo* by Stieg Larsson
* *Roadside Picnic* by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky
* *The Hunger Games* by Suzanne Collins

It is helpful to always have a book on you, or have an ebook on your phone.
I find that the best types of books for phone reading are those that can be
read in short bursts, while remaining memorable.
Try *Gangster Redemption* by Larry Lawton or *Girl, Interrupted* by Susanna Kaysen.

### Code Something 💻

* Never wrote code before? Start with a website. You can even view the
source code of this site [here]({{ site.github_url }})!
* Automate something tedious you'd rather not do
* Interact with some old hardware
* Perhaps remake an arcade game?

## Starting and Ending Your Day

These suggestions don't particularly require a lot of brain power...

* Read a mindless book, like the [H2G2 series](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Novels)
* Work on a [big puzzle](https://www.whitemountainpuzzles.com/) 🧩
* Journal your thoughts for the day 🤔
* Start a dream journal! Practice [lucid dreaming](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/dreams/lucid-dreams) 😴
